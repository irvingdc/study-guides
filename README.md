## üöÄ How to Use This Repository

### For Interview Preparation

1. **Start with fundamentals**: Begin with SOLID principles and system design fundamentals
2. **Follow the progression**: Each part builds upon previous concepts
3. **Practice with examples**: Work through the provided code examples and case studies
4. **Draw diagrams**: Practice creating system architecture diagrams
5. **Focus on trade-offs**: Understand the pros/cons of different approaches
6. **Time yourself**: Practice explaining concepts within typical interview timeframes

### Study Approach

```
Week 1-2: SOLID Principles + System Design Fundamentals
Week 3-4: Design Patterns + System Components  
Week 5-6: Code Quality + Distributed Patterns
Week 7-8: Testing & Performance + Storage & Messaging
Week 9-10: Advanced Topics + Scalability
Week 11-12: Case Studies + Interview Practice
```

### Key Learning Objectives

**For Refactoring & Maintenance:**
- Master SOLID principles with practical examples
- Identify and eliminate code smells
- Apply design patterns appropriately
- Write testable and maintainable code
- Optimize application performance

**For System Design:**
- Design scalable distributed systems
- Make informed architectural trade-offs  
- Estimate capacity and performance requirements
- Handle system failures gracefully
- Design for observability and operations

## üí° Interview Tips

### General Preparation
- **Practice explaining concepts**: Be ready to teach these topics to others
- **Use real examples**: Reference systems you've worked with
- **Discuss trade-offs**: There's rarely a perfect solution
- **Ask clarifying questions**: Understand requirements before designing
- **Start simple**: Begin with basic solutions, then add complexity

### Time Management (60-minute interview)
- **10 minutes**: Requirements gathering and clarification
- **15 minutes**: High-level design and architecture
- **20 minutes**: Detailed design of key components
- **10 minutes**: Scalability and optimization discussion
- **5 minutes**: Monitoring, security, and operational concerns

## üìã Prerequisites

- 3+ years of software development experience
