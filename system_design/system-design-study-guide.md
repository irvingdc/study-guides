# System Design Study Guide - Comprehensive Interview Preparation

## Overview
This comprehensive study guide covers all essential System Design concepts for senior software engineering interviews at companies like Zillow. The guide progresses from fundamental concepts to complex distributed systems, explaining the "why" behind architectural decisions.

## Study Structure

### Part 1: Fundamentals and Core Concepts
- Basic building blocks of distributed systems
- Client-server architecture evolution
- Network fundamentals (TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets)
- Latency, throughput, and bandwidth concepts
- CAP theorem and its practical implications
- ACID vs BASE properties
- Consistency models (strong, eventual, weak)
- System reliability metrics (SLA, SLO, SLI)

### Part 2: Components and Building Blocks
- Load balancers (L4 vs L7, algorithms, health checks)
- Reverse proxies and API gateways
- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- Web servers vs application servers
- Service discovery and service mesh
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Circuit breakers and bulkheads
- Distributed tracing and monitoring

### Part 3: Distributed System Patterns
- Microservices architecture patterns
- Service-oriented architecture (SOA)
- Event-driven architecture
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Event sourcing
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- API design patterns (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Synchronous vs asynchronous communication

### Part 4: Storage and Databases
- SQL vs NoSQL decision matrix
- Database replication strategies
- Database sharding techniques
- Data partitioning strategies
- Caching strategies and patterns
- Redis vs Memcached
- Time-series databases
- Graph databases
- Data warehousing and data lakes
- ETL vs ELT pipelines

### Part 5: Communication and Messaging
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, SQS)
- Pub/Sub systems (Kafka, Redis Pub/Sub)
- Streaming platforms (Kafka, Kinesis)
- WebSockets and Server-Sent Events
- Long polling vs short polling
- Protocol buffers and data serialization
- Service mesh and inter-service communication

### Part 6: Scalability and Performance
- Horizontal vs vertical scaling
- Database scaling strategies
- Caching at different layers
- Performance optimization techniques
- Auto-scaling strategies
- Global distribution and geo-replication
- Edge computing
- Capacity planning and load testing

### Part 7: Real-World Case Studies
- Design a URL shortener (bit.ly)
- Design a social media feed (Twitter timeline)
- Design a video streaming platform (YouTube/Netflix)
- Design a ride-sharing system (Uber/Lyft)
- Design a payment system (Stripe/PayPal)
- Design a real estate platform (Zillow specific)
- Design a collaborative editing system (Google Docs)
- Design a distributed file storage (Dropbox)

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Start with fundamentals** (Part 1) even if you think you know them - they form the foundation for everything else
2. **Practice drawing diagrams** for each concept as you learn
3. **Focus on trade-offs** - there's rarely a perfect solution
4. **Study progressively** - each part builds on the previous
5. **Apply concepts to real systems** you've worked with
6. **Practice estimations** - back-of-envelope calculations are crucial

## Interview Approach Framework

### 1. Requirements Gathering (5-10 minutes)
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Scale and constraints
- Success metrics

### 2. Capacity Estimation (5 minutes)
- Traffic estimates
- Storage requirements
- Bandwidth calculations
- Server count estimates

### 3. High-Level Design (10-15 minutes)
- Draw main components
- Show data flow
- Identify APIs

### 4. Detailed Design (15-20 minutes)
- Database schema
- Algorithm details
- API specifications
- Data structures

### 5. Scale and Optimize (10-15 minutes)
- Identify bottlenecks
- Propose solutions
- Discuss trade-offs

### 6. Additional Considerations (5-10 minutes)
- Security measures
- Monitoring and alerting
- Deployment strategy
- Disaster recovery

## Key Technologies to Know

### AWS Services (Most Common)
- EC2, ELB, Auto Scaling Groups
- S3, CloudFront
- RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache
- SQS, SNS, Kinesis
- Lambda, API Gateway
- Route 53, VPC

### Other Important Technologies
- Docker and Kubernetes
- Apache Kafka
- Elasticsearch
- MongoDB, Cassandra
- Redis, Memcached
- Nginx, HAProxy
- Prometheus, Grafana

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-engineering** - Start simple, then scale
2. **Ignoring constraints** - Always clarify requirements
3. **No trade-off discussion** - Every decision has pros/cons
4. **Missing monitoring** - Production systems need observability
5. **Forgetting failure modes** - Design for failure
6. **Skipping estimations** - Numbers matter in system design

## Time Management for 60-Minute Interview

- 0-10 min: Requirements and estimations
- 10-25 min: High-level architecture
- 25-40 min: Deep dive into 2-3 components
- 40-50 min: Scaling and optimizations
- 50-60 min: Trade-offs and wrap-up

## Next Steps

Each part of this guide has a detailed companion document that thoroughly explains concepts with examples, diagrams (described), and real-world applications. Study them in order for the best learning experience.

Remember: System design is about making informed trade-offs, not finding perfect solutions.
